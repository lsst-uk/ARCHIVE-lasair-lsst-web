Lasair is a broker for astronomers studying transient and variable astrophysical sources.
It is being developed as a collaboration between the
<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> and
<a href=http://www.qub.ac.uk/>Queen's University, Belfast</a>
to build a broker service for alerts generated by the 
<a href=https://www.lsst.org/>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>. 
We are planning to serve LSST transient alerts to the LSST user community and combine 
these data with value-added cross-matches against existing catalogues and analysis tools.
</p><p>
To help prototype the functionality needed to process alerts from LSST, 
Lasair is currently ingesting and presenting alerts from the public stream of the 
<a href=http://www.ztf.caltech.edu>Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>,
which is releasing a transient alert stream in a format similar to that envisaged for LSST. 
We thank ZTF for access to this valuable public data stream. 
Lasair provides a broker system for users to access, visualise and extract science data. 
</p><p>
To find out what Lasair can do and how to use it, please look at the <a href=/about>About Lasair</a> link
to the left, and the <a href=https://lsst-uk.atlassian.net/l/c/1S1VEAAo>Lasair Cookbook</a>.

<h4>Lasair 2.0</h4>
On 9th April 2020 we released the stable, functioning version 2.0 of the Lasair broker for 
processing ZTF alerts. The additions and improvements in this release are
<ul>
<li>Documentation as above
<li>A new, upgraded version of the context classifier <a href=/sherlock>Sherlock Version 2.0</a>
<li>We provide a forward look to our broad plans to develop Lasair for the LSST alert stream
<li>Lasair provides Kafka output for query/filters: <a href="mailto:lasair-help@lists.roe.ac.uk?subject=Notebooks">contact us</a> for more information.
