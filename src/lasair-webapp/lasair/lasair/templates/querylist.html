<h4>Promoted Queries and Filters</h4>
The following are stored queries and filters from Lasair. First the "promoted queries",
then your stored queries, then stored queries from others that have been made public.
<p>
The first link shows a definition of the query, and there is a button 'Run Query'.
If you are logged in, you see a button 'Copy this Query', so you can copy
to your own space, then modify it.
If you are the owner of this query, you can modify it, then 'Save this Query'.
You can also 'Delete this Query'.

The second link (Filter Log) is there for <i>filters</i>, which are queries that run 
in real time as the alerts come in. It shows a cache of the output from that filter,
latest first. You can modify your own query and convert it to a filter
by modifying it as above, choosing one of the 'Convert to filter' options.
